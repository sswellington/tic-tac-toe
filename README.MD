Classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is played by two players, usually referred to as "X" and "O", who take turns marking the spaces in the grid with their respective symbols. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The game begins with an empty grid, and the first player places their symbol in an empty space. The second player then takes their turn, and the game continues until one player wins or the grid is completely filled without either player achieving three in a row. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game is considered a draw.

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game, but it can be used to teach important concepts such as strategy and critical thinking. It is often used as a teaching tool for children and is enjoyed by people of all ages.
